                <p style="color: white; padding: 0px 0px 10px 10px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;I was born in Moscow&#44; Russia May 29th 1997 and have been told my real mother whos name is Tatiana had to give me up due to wanting a better
                    life for me somewhere else&period; An American couple by the names of Thomas Tomczyk and Debra Tomczyk flew all the way out to Moscow to come and get me&period;
                    I couldn&apos;t tell you why they wanted a Russian child&#44; but I like to belive its because Russians are the best&period;
                    I was also told that I took very kidley to the flight attendant and I did not want to leave her arms for most of the flight&period;
                    From a young age we had moved around quite a bit if my memory serves me well&period; We had lived in North Carolina&#44; Memphis&#44; and even Florida before finally moving to Pennsylvainia&period;
                    Now we lived in an appartment around Elizebethtown which is near Hershey&period; From there we moved into are current residence in Manchester which is 20 minutes away from York City&period;

                <P style=" color: white; padding: 0px 0px 10px 10px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;As a young child I had always like to play different sports&period; When I was younger I would play Baseball in the Fall &amp; Spring while I would
                    play basketball in the Winter&period; In the summer I would try and play travel baseball&#44; but I can&apos;t remember how many times I did that&period;
                    I did however play AAU&#44; and 3v3 basketball tournements as I got older&period; When I was in 6th grade I had tried football and I was really really good&period;
                    I know it was youth level&#44; but that year I hadn&apos;t dropped one pass even though our QB Ty Folkner couldn&apos;t throw the ball to save his life&period; He literally costed me
                    two touchdowns I could have gotten that year&#44; but football wasn&apos;t meant to be as I got a rib contusion and a concusion&period; Now I don&apos;t remember how old I was&#44; but I do know that during one of my fall
                    baseball years I had gotten pulled from pitching in a game I really wanted to continue in and because of that I never played baseball again for years&period; So as a result of the fallout with baseball and not
                    persuing football anymore I had focused on playing basketball as my main sport through Middle School and High School&period; I had never made the school teams untill my 10th grade year&#44; but I was always on a team that was right below the school
                    team&period; It was because of coach Webster that I had continued to develope even though I wasn&apos;t on the school team&period; That and I also went to Wake&hyphen;Forrest &amp; Messiah basketball camp
                    for a total of 5 or 6 years that really helped me realize my true potential&period; My main highlight from all thoses years was being able to beat a 7 foot player
                    in a one vs one tournement at Messiah&period; My first year one the school team went really well even though it was only JV&#44; I had become a massive defensive threat and an excellent three&hyphen;point
                    shooter&period; The second year didn&apos;t got so well as I had 2 concusions and was still on the JV roster&period; My senior year was very different though as I tried out for the soccer team
                    having never played soccer before&period; Suprisingly enough I mde the Varsity squad and ended up scoring my only goal that gave us the only win that season&period;
